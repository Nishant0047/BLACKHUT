This charge can be carried by various charged particles, most commonly electrons, but also ions (atoms that have lost or gained electrons).  This flow, or current, is driven by an electrical potential difference, often called voltage.  Voltage is a measure of the electrical potential energy per unit charge.  The higher the voltage, the greater the \"push\" on the charges, causing them to flow more readily.\\n\\nIn simpler terms:  Imagine electricity as water flowing through pipes.  Voltage is like the water pressure, pushing the water (electrons) through the pipes (wires). The amount of water flowing is like the current (amperage).\\n\\nElectricity is a fundamental force of nature and has many applications, powering everything from light bulbs to computers.  It\\'s a form of energy that can be converted into other forms of energy, such as light, heat, and motion.\\n'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":14}]}]}
